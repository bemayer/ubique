# Rubique

Rubique is a modern reimplementation of the Ubique mathematical and quantitative library. Built with contemporary JavaScript, TypeScript, and Deno, Rubique delivers high-performance numerical computations by leveraging Rust’s [nalgebra](https://nalgebra.org/) library compiled to WebAssembly. The library provides a comprehensive suite of functions for vectors, matrices, linear algebra, statistics, time series analysis, and computational finance.

## Overview

Rubique is designed for modern web and server-side applications requiring robust and efficient mathematical operations. By integrating WebAssembly for heavy linear algebra tasks and using Deno as its runtime, Rubique offers a secure and developer-friendly environment. The library supports vectors, matrices, linear algebra, statistics, time series analysis, and computational finance—all while maintaining exceptional performance compared to traditional JavaScript solutions.

## Key Features

- **Modern Syntax & Tooling:** Written in TypeScript and running on Deno for improved development experience, security, and performance.
- **Efficient Linear Algebra:** Uses Rust’s [nalgebra](https://nalgebra.org/) compiled to WebAssembly to accelerate matrix operations.
- **Comprehensive Functionality:** Provides a full suite of operations for vectors and matrices, including elementary operations, statistics, time series analysis, and financial computations.
- **High Performance:** Benchmarks show significant speed improvements over traditional JavaScript libraries, making Rubique ideal for computation-intensive applications.

## Performance Highlights

Rubique demonstrates substantial performance gains in matrix multiplication. Here’s a sample benchmark comparing Rubique’s custom matrix multiplication against a traditional JavaScript library (e.g., math.js):

| Matrix Size | rubique (ms) | math.js (ms) | Faster (%) |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 10x10       | 0.07         | 0.32         | 77.38      |
| 100x100     | 4.03         | 11.02        | 63.44      |
| 1000x1000   | 1089.51      | 42508.00     | 97.44      |

*These results highlight Rubique's potential in handling heavy matrix operations efficiently.*

## Installation

Ensure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed, then import Rubique directly into your project:

``` ts
import * as rubique from 'https://github.com/bemayer/rubique/mod.ts';
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bemayer/rubique.git
cd rubique
```

## Usage

Below is a quick example demonstrating matrix multiplication with Rubique:

``` ts
import * as rubique from 'https://github.com/bemayer/rubique/mod.ts';

const A = rubique.matrix([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
]);

const B = rubique.matrix([
  [5, 6],
  [7, 8],
]);

const C = rubique.multiply(A, B);
console.log(C);
// Expected Output:
// [
//   [19, 22],
//   [43, 50],
// ]
```

Rubique’s API is designed to be intuitive, closely mirroring familiar operations from Ubique and MATLAB-like environments.

## Roadmap

Rubique is an ongoing project with a clear vision for continuous improvement. Planned enhancements include:

[ ] **Documentation Tests:** Add all tests to the `@example` sections to leverage Deno’s documentation testing.
[ ] **Enhanced WebAssembly Usage:** Generalize the use of WebAssembly for heavy matrix operations to further boost performance.
[ ] **Refactoring:** Complete the refactoring of the `quants` function to ensure consistency and reliability.
[ ] **Type Improvements:** Clean up type definitions to avoid the overuse of `any` and ensure robust TypeScript support.
