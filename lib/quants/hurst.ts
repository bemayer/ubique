 * @method hurst
 * @summary Hurst index/exponent
 * @description It's a useful statistic for detecting if a time series is mean reverting (anti-persistent), totally random or persistent.
 * A value in the range [0.5) indicates mean-reverting (anti-persistent)
 * A value of 0.5 indicate a random walk
 * A value H in the range (0.5,1] indicates momentum (persistent)
 * 
 * @param  {array|matrix} x array of values
 * @param  {number} flag normalization value 0: population, 1:sample (def: 1)
 * @param  {number} dim dimension 0: row, 1: column (def: 0)
 * @return {number|array|matrix}
 *
 * @example
 * var x = [0.003,0.026,0.015,-0.009,0.014,0.024,0.015,0.066,-0.014,0.039];
 * var y = [-0.005,0.081,0.04,-0.037,-0.061,0.058,-0.049,-0.021,0.062,0.058];
 * 
 * ubique.hurst(x);
 * // 0.344059
 * 
 * ubique.hurst(x,1);
 * // 0.3669383
 * 
 * ubique.hurst(ubique.cat(0,x,y));
 * // [ [ 0.344059 ], [ 0.51531 ] ]
